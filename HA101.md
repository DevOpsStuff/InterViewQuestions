# HA 101

## What is HA?
   * Minimization of system Downtime
   * Minimization of data/transaction loss
   * In cae of multiple failures,Minimization of data loss 
     is preferred over minimization of System downtime.

## Implementing HA

  * Elimination of SPOF
     - Redundancy of network components


## Stateless Vs Stateful
   - Stateless
   
     * There is no dependency between requests
     * No need for data replication/sync
   - Statefull
   
     * An action typically compises multiple requests
     * Data needs to be replicated and synchronized between redundant services

## HA and Scalability:
  - Active/Passive:
    * There is a single master
    * A stateful service a replcaement resources can be brought online. A seprate application monitors there services,
      
  - Active/Active
    * Multiple masters -scales out

Coming Soon. Need to add More
